# Ways-Of-Installing-Python

I have to explain how to install Python all the time, so I'm going to compile my usual instructions into this repository for reuse.  Maybe you'll find this helpful?  Maybe not. 

Note the hedges as reported in the actual document.  This will have a prefefnce for installation methods that I need to use first, and then I can add other things as I explore them later.
