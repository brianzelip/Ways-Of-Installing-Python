# Ways-Of-Installing-Python

I have to explain how to install Python all the time, so I'm going to compile my usual instructions into this repository for reuse.  Maybe you'll find this helpful?  Maybe not.  I have opinions about which things to use, and I'm fine with them.  You should have your own opinions and be fine with them.  Our opinions can differ and we'll all survive.

Note the hedges as reported in the actual document.  Mainly, this will have a preference for installation methods that I need to use with my students first, and then I can add other things as I explore them later. This is not meant to be the final, solo, or One True word.
